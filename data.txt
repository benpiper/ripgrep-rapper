This is a test file for ripgrep rapper.
We drop bars and find numbers.

Line 3: Here is a number 404-555-1234 within some text.
Line 4: Another format: (404) 555-1234 is also valid.
Line 5: Just digits 4045551234 representation.
Line 6: Garbage text.
Line 7: More garbage.
Line 8: Even more garbage.
Line 9: Context line before.
Line 10: Context line before that.
Line 11: 404-555-1234 showing up again.
Line 12: Context line after.
Line 13: Context line after that.
Line 15: Weird format 404 555-1234

Long line test:
This is a very long line that should be folded because it contains a lot of text but we only care about the match which is 404-555-1234 right here in the middle, and then the line continues for a very long time with irrelevant information that should probably be truncated by our folding logic if it works correctly. This represents a minified JS file or something similar. 01234567890

Another long line without match:
This is just a long line with no match in it. It might show up as context if it's near a match. We want to see how the folding handles context lines that are super long but don't contain the highlighted term. It should truncate the end.

404.555.1234 (Dot notation, might not be covered by current regex but let's see).
